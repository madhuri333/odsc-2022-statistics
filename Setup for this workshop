We will be working through examples where we generate simulated data and apply statistical methods to those results.

We will walk through the steps one needs to take to effectively explore, validate, and analyze a new dataset.

The bulk of the work will be in the python notebooks in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/zirmite/odsc-2022-statistics

You will need to have git installed on your laptop:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

And then run the following in a terminal:
git clone https://github.com/zirmite/odsc-2022-statistics

This will copy the files from the repo to your machine. 

Once those files are there you can use them as a reference or if you want to follow along during the tutorial:

Use pipenv to both install dependencies and set up a virtual environment in which to run the code. First youâ€™ll need to install pipenv. Then you can run pipenv install to install all the dependencies listed in the Pipfile. 

Set jupyter running using either pipenv run jupyter lab or jupyter lab.
